  1.  <br>
 here is a poem i submitted to the rattle poetry competition, i lost :) 
  <br> if u make fun of the title ur cursed :(    its called: <br>  <br>
  <u> to the gods we must be atoms to the atoms we must be gods </u> <br>  <br>
    An instance of reflection <br>
    Seizes my attention <br>
    An optical illusion gazes in my direction <br> 
    To the creature I feel no connection <br>
    The confrontation results in projection <br>
    <br>
    A glimmer past the vanity <br>
    All I can ensure of reality <br>
    The only guarantee of divinity<br> 
    I feel my body explicitly <br>
    <br>
    Eerie and self intimate <br>
    The borders of my sanity <br> 
    A limit to the infinite <br>
    Yet all that a god can be  <br>
    <br>
    I feel in my breath <br>
    The strength of the heft <br>
    My diaphragm carries the load on my chest <br>
    <br>
    It is all but it is empty <br>
    It is relief but it is heavy <br>
    Liberation at the ready <br>
    Desperation to be steady <br>
    <br>
    Paralyzed by the depth of my consciousness<br>
    Physically severed at the base<br>
    I am improving my combat against the feeling of material delay <br>
    <br>
    I fear that this feeling is more than I can take <br>
    Each time gets harder to return from this state <br>
    The further I go the narrower my escape <br>
    But around my body I have a life to maintain <br>
    <br>
    So I fold up the vastness <br>
    And pack it away <br>
    Force my eyes to dilate <br>
    There are a few hours left of today<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

   <br>
   These days we await<br>
the solar barge nears west <br>
to allow us to indulge<br>
we find recreation in altered states <br>
and dress up dates <br>
give us strepitous sites<br>
boisterous nights<br>
building ferver off bartered sleep <br>
a necessary release<br>
